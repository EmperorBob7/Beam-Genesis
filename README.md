# Beam-Genesis
* 1st place for Best Solo Game
* Developed in 2 days for the Texas Game Jam 2022 hosted by EGaDS!
* Playable on [Itch.io](https://emperor-bob.itch.io/beam-genesis)
* Developed in Godot
* Theme for the Jam was "Negative Space"

## Notes
* Try to ignore the messy file structure, it was my first time using Godot and 2 days didn't give me a lot of prep time.
* Easter Egg on the "Thanks for playing" stage
* There is a bug on the level with the Longhorn, try not to let the piston push you all the way over.
* Music was made by [Lukrembo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P4wn4ITE_Q)
* Music only plays through one side of headphones
